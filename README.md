# Portfolio Website

## Description

My motivation to make this this week was to make a framework of a portfolio website, so that I can later update it the more I learn.
I built this portfolio website to store future projects that I can show off to potential employers.
I learned more about CSS and how to apply it. This really helped with learning how to write a website from scratch and really helped get my interest from CSS.
